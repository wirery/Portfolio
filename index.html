    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ryan, and I am a former teacher, turned software engineer. I have always had a love of learning, and chose software engineering because I enjoy solving problems, and the challenges the job gives me.  Academically, I have always been a quick learner, earning my master's degree in Curriculum and Instruction, while also working fulltime as an educator.  Over the years, I have gained a great deal of experience in the workforce, learning to organize, communicate, and plan my tasks before proceeding forward. As a teacher, I learned how to work as a team with my colleagues to troubleshoot problems, and I was appointed grade level chair in only my second year as a teacher. I apply all these skills to my work on a daily basis, and would love the opportunity to work with others to accomplish their projects as well. </p>
